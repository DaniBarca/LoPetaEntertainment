# ShowOut! - Ludum Dare Challenge 42

This is the game we did in 48h for the Ludum Dare 42 with the theme "Running Out of Space".
You can play it at https://danibarca.github.io/LoPetaEntertainment/ or download it for windows from releases.

Use left click to shoot enemies and right click over a tile to reload the gun, removing the tile in the process.
